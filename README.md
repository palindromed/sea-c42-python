##Hannah Krager
I stumbled onto Python and coding while studying linguisitics and changed course to study programming.


###Not Coding:
When I am not sitting in front of a computer, hiking, reading awesome books and watching [Doctor Who](http://www.bbcamerica.com/doctor-who/) and hanging out with my husband and friends keep me busy.
