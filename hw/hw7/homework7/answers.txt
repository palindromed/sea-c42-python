Homework 7

For each problem that requires a written answer, write (or copy-and-paste)
your answers in this file.  When you are done, you should have replaced all
the ellipses (the three dots) with your answers.

At the end, you will turn in this file along with your modified
dna_analysis.py program.


Problem 1:

(No answers in this file.)

Problem 2:
GC-content: 0.4302926296296296
...

Problem 3:
When those variable assignment lines are commented out, a NameError occurs.
That is because the variables are referenced without ever being assigned.
...

Problem 4:
GC-content: 0.4302926296296296
AT-content:  0.5689938518518518
...

Problem 5:
G nucleotides present: 5738773
C nucleotides present: 5879128
A nucleotides present: 7701287
T nucleotides present: 7661547
...

Problem 6:
The sum of the individual counts of A, T, C and G is different from both
the seq variable length and the total_count. These variables pick up the
non A, T, C and G characters that we are not interested in for these
calculations, so neither the length of seq or total_count can accurately be used as the denominator when calculating AT or GC content.
The sum of the individual counts of A,T,C and G is the denominator that gives an accurate answer.
...

Problem 7:
AT/GC Ratio: 1.3223416174746196
...

Problem 8:
GC Classification: moderate GC content
...

Collaboration:
I did not collaborate with anyone for this assignment

Reflection:
With an assignment like this, attention to detail is most important. I spent too much time stuck on things that had to do with understanding what I was looking for rather than writing and testing code. I have done similar projects in the past, so there wasn't much new to me but it was great review and practice.
