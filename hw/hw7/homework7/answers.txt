Homework 7

For each problem that requires a written answer, write (or copy-and-paste)
your answers in this file.  When you are done, you should have replaced all
the ellipses (the three dots) with your answers.

At the end, you will turn in this file along with your modified
dna_analysis.py program.


Problem 1:

(No answers in this file.)

Problem 2:
GC-content: 0.4302926296296296
...

Problem 3:
When those variable assignment lines are commented out, a NameError occurs.
...

Problem 4:
GC-content: 0.4302926296296296
AT-content:  0.5689938518518518
...

Problem 5:
G nucleotides present: 5738773
C nucleotides present: 5879128
A nucleotides present: 7701287
T nucleotides present: 7661547
...

Problem 6:
The sum of the individual counts of A, T, C and G is different from both
the seq variable length and the total_count. These variables pick up the
non A, T, C and G characters in the file, so neither the length of seq or
total_count can be used as the denominator when calculating AT or GC content.
The sum of the individual
